# Video Search Engine

## About
This application is a local search engine for videos which works on any specified directory. 
<br>Given a query, the search engine will not only search for video titles that match the query but it will also consider the content of the videos. 
So, if a sentence *S* is spoken in a video *V* and the query matches *S*, *V* will be in the results. Texts documents in the specified directory are also considered by the search engine.
<br>The most relevant results are then displayed to the user.
If the user clicks on a video result, it will open that video at a time around which the relevant words of the query were mentioned.
